| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Decision Tree     | 0.9457     | 83.71%       | 0.691     | 1.170     |
| Random Forest     | 0.9573     | 87.92%       | 0.614     | 1.038     |
| **Extra Trees**   | **0.9616** | **89.12%**   | **0.542** | **0.984** |
| Bagging Regressor | 0.9540     | 87.57%       | 0.647     | 1.077     |

📌 Key Takeaways

Resale value is strongly influenced by present price, fuel type, and seller type.

Ensemble models such as Extra Trees and Random Forest provided better results than a standalone Decision Tree.

Feature engineering played an important role in improving prediction accuracy.

📈 Scope for Improvement

Add more features like brand reputation, previous owners, and service history.

Experiment with deep learning methods (ANN) for capturing complex non-linear patterns.

Extend the work into a simple Flask/Django web application for live predictions.
